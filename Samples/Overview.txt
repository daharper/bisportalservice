This service:
    * configures itself from a settings file 
    * executes the specified batch file providing the jar file as argument
    * monitors changes in the settings file folder and reacts accordingly

There are three types of changes:
    * A new jar file is dropped in the settings folder
    * An executing jar file is overwritten in the settings folder
    * The batchfile or jar file setting is updated in the settings file

The services looks for the settings.xml in the following places:
    * first it tries BIZPORTAL_SETTINGS environment variable 
    * if not, it defaults to d:\bizportalReskin\api\Settings.xml
    
    (See Settings.ResolveFilename() for more details)

Prepare the settings:
    * configure the settings file and copy it to the base folder (i.e. d:\bizportalReskin\api)
    * ensure the fully qualified path of batch file and jar file points to the correct artifacts
    * the batch file should expect a single argument which is the jar file name (see below example)
    * copy the bizportal.exe (and .pdb for symbols if wanted) to the base folder

Installing the service:
    * cd to .NET Framework 4.0 folder (i.e. c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319)
    * in cmd (admin) run: installutil.exe d:\path_to_bizportal\BizportalService.exe    
    
    (Install .NET Framework 4.0 if it is missing, easy than using sc.exe which often requires reboots)

Running the service:
    * ensure Spring is not running (for bizportal)
    * the service is configured to start automatically on boot
    * to start it for the first time without rebooting:
        - press Win + R
        - type: services.msc
        - select for BizportalService
        - click 'start'

Verify everything is okay:
    * The service should start without issue, and stay 'started' in services.msc
    * navigate to the Spring localhost URL confirm spring is running

    (configuring a service can sometimes be a chore, the file might not be in the right place, 
    permissions may not be adequate, etc. if there are issues, you may need to update the
    code and redeploy. If the service is not running, you should be able to deploy over
    the top of the previous bizportalservice.exe without re-installing the service.)
    
If you need to uninstall the service:
    * cd to the .net framework (4) folder again
    * run: installutil.exe /uninstall d:\path_to_bizportal\BizportalService.exe
    * refresh the services view, it should be gone

Example settings file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Settings xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <Filename>c:\Source\Settings.xml</Filename>
  <BatchFile>c:\Source\startup.bat</BatchFile>
  <JarFile>c:\Source\demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</JarFile>
  <MonitorChanges>true</MonitorChanges>
</Settings>

Example batch file:

java -jar %1

Example directory structure:

c:\source\
    settings.xml
    demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    startup.bat

This is fine for SIT or UAT, but in PROD you may wish to version releases and update the config to
point to the new jar file, i.e.

c:\source\
    settings.xml
    startup.bat
    RELEASE_1\
        demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    RELEASE_2\
        demo-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar

You don't have to do this, you can just drop newer versions directly in the base folder (c:\source in this case)
and the configuration file will automatically be updated to use this new file, and it will stop the previous
process and run with the new configuration.

There should be no need to move the batch file, and this hasn't been tested, but it should be no problem
as we are using fully qualified filenames in the settings file.
